# VGG-ImageNet
This project aims to replicate and explore the groundbreaking architecture of "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition" by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman, which demonstrated the significant impact of network depth on accuracy in image recognition tasks, using Tiny ImageNet Data.
